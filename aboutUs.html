	  		<p>I am a junior studying Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of St. Thomas. I have interned at Thomson Reuters as a software engineer and I plan to work there is upcoming summer. I love computer science because it forces me to be efficient and creative when problem solving. The skills I have learned from it are applicable for many aspects of life.

	  		<p> In my free time, I work with Dr. Scott Yilek on research. I also participate in PULSE, a dance club on campus, and computer science club. My hobbies include watching Game of Thrones, exercising, eating at new restaurants, and hanging out with my sister (who is a freshman at UST).

  		<p>I am a senior studying Applied Mathematics at the University of St. Thomas. Near the end of my Sophmore year, after taking an Intro to Computer Science course, I decided to pair my math major with a CS minor. After graduation, I am starting a job at Wells Fargo as an Associate Internal Auditor and I could not be more excited!</p>
  		<p>Along with schooling, I keep busy with a part-time job working for Hennepin County Government Center in their Information Technology department. I also recently became an assistant coach for my old high school's dance team and kept my passion for dance alive. With the little free time I have, I like to spend time exploring and trying out new restaurants and breweries located around the cities with my family and friends.</p>
