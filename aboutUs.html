  		<p>I am a senior studying Applied Mathematics at the University of St. Thomas. Near the end of my Sophmore year, after taking an Intro to Computer Science course, I decided to pair my math major with a CS minor. After graduation, I am starting a job at Wells Fargo as an Associate Internal Auditor and I could not be more excited!</p>
  		<p>Along with schooling, I keep busy with a part-time job working for Hennepin County Government Center in their Information Technology department. I also recently became an assiatnt coach for my old high school's dance team and kept my passion for dance alive. With the little free time I have, I like to spsnd time exploring and trying out new restaurants and breweries located around the cities with my family and friends.</p>
